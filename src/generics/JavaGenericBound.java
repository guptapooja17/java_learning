/*
 * There may be times when you want to restrict the types that can be used as type arguments in a parameterized type.
 *  For example, a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Number or its subclasses. 
 *  This is what bounded type parameters are for. 
 *  Sometimes we donâ€™t want whole class to be parameterized, in that case we can create java generics method. 
 *  Since constructor is a special kind of method,we can use generics type in constructors too. 
 *  
 *  Suppose we want to restrict the type of objects that can be used in the parameterized type. 
 *  For example in a method that compares two objects and we want to make sure that the accepted objects are Comparables.
 *  
 *  The invocation of these methods is similar to unbounded method except that if we will try to use any class that is not Comparable,
 *  it will throw compile time error.
