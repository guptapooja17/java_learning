/* 
 * Starting in Java 10, you have the option of using the keyword var instead of the type for local variables under certain conditions.
 * To use this feature, you just type var instead of the primitive or reference type.
 * The formal name of this feature is local variable type inference.
 * First comes local variable . This means just what it sounds like. You can only use this feature for local variables only.
 * what type inference means. When you type var, you are instructing the compiler to determine the type for you.
 * The compiler looks at the code on the line of the declaration and uses it to infer the type.
